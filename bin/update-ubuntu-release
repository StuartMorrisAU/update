# Upgrade an Ubuntu operating system by running do-release-upgrade.
#
# ## How to choose upgrades
#
# You may want to edit the file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades,
# where you can set the release upgrade strategy: lts, normal, or never.
# You need root privileges to edit this file.
#
#   * Prompt=lts means do upgrades that are long term support (LTS).
#   * Prompt=normal means do upgrades to any newer release.
#   * Prompt=never means never do release upgrades
#
# ## Suggestion when using SSH and iptable
#
# If you are running `do-release-upgrade` on some kinds of systems,
# you may see a prompt about opening an additional SSH port on 1022,
# and advising you to open the port by using the `iptables` such as:
#
#     iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT
#
# If you see this, then it's wise and safe to cancel the upgrade,
# then run the `iptables` command, then retry the upgrade process.
#
# ## Troubleshooting "Error authenticating some packages"
#
# If you an error message about "Error authenticating some packages",
# then you must fix the problem and then retry the update and upgrade.
#
# Many web forums advise disabling authentication, which is a bad idea.
# We advise against any `unauth.cfg` file because it disables security.
#
# Our solution is to remove all the unauthenticated packages, 
# then do the upgrade, then do a fresh install of the packages.
#
# ## Troubleshooting an upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04 or higher.
#
# Upgrading from 14.04 to 15.04 directly is not supported. 
# You'd have to do 14.04 -> 14.10 -> 15.04, which will not work,
# because 14.10 has reached End Of Life.
#
# 15.04 will reach EOL is January 2016, which makes upgrading unworthy.
#
# We recommend staying on 14.04, and upgrading to 16.04 when it's ready,
# which is in summer 2016.
#
# If you do choose to try upgrading from 14.04 to 15.04 or higher,
# heads up that there may be major bugs, especially in systemd,
# and the bugs may cause any reboot to fail and be unrecoverable.
#
# Forum posts say to run this after the upgrade:
#
#     sudo apt-get install systemd-sysv
# 
# We return true, no matter what, because the do-release-upgrade
# command returns 1 if there's no upgrade needed, which would quit.
# TODO: handle this so it continues if there's no upgrade needed.
#
if command -v do-release-upgrade >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    sudo do-release-upgrade || true

# Brew for macOS
#
# Update Homebrew package manager for Apple macOS.
#
# This update process has extra handling that in practice
# tends to fix trouble before it gets too far out of hand.
#
# Our general approach is to first try to update via item-by-item,
# then second to try to update via the typical Homebrew command.
#
#
# ## Troubleshooting unreadable
#
# If you get an error like this:
#
#     Error: Cask 'foo' is unreadable â€¦
#
# Then try deleting the cask like this:
#
#     $ rm /usr/local/Caskroom/foo
#
#
# ## Troubleshooting ownership
#
# Caution: major macOS upgrades result in /usr/local ownership reverted
# to root:wheel. We have improved the situation already, but there's one
# migration you need to do which requires writing permission of /usr/local.
#
#     sudo chown "$(whoami)" /usr/local
#     cd /usr/local
#     git fetch
#     git reset --hard origin/master
#     brew update --force
#
if command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Brew strongly prefers to run as the current user.
    # Otherwise, brew tends to carp due to ownership issues.

    brew_uid="$(stat -f %u "$(brew --cellar)")"

# If you want the system to force saying yes, use this setting:
#
#     sudo apt-get --yes --force-yes ...
#
# If you want the update to be quieter, use the --quiet option:
#
#     sudo apt-get --quiet ...
#
# If you want the system to automatically use default answers
# whenever an interactive prompt appears, use this setting:
#
#     sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get ...
#
# If you want to combine all of the above:
#
#     sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get --quiet --yes --force-yes ...

# This script attempts 3 kinds of upgrades in order of complexity:
# upgrade, dist-upgrade, full-upgrade.
#
# From the man page:
#
# * upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages
#   currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
#   /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new
#   versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no
#   circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages
#   not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of
#   currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without
#   changing the install status of another package will be left at
#   their current version. An update must be performed first so that
#   apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.
#
# * dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,
#   also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions
#   of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and
#   it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the
#   expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade
#   command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file
#   contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package
#   files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding
#   the general settings for individual packages.
#
# * full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but may also remove
#   installed packages if that is required in order to resolve a
#   package conflict.
